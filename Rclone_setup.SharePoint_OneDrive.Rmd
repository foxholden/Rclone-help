## Microsoft OneDrive

This is how to configure rclone to a upload and download files from our ReuggLab_BGP_Share SharePoint site

https://colostate.sharepoint.com/sites/RueggLab_BGP_Share/

First get the NEWEST version of rclone (old version won't have the option we need)

```
https://rclone.org/downloads/
```
Paths are specified as __remote:path__

Configuration

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from Microsoft which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

```
rclone config
```

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
